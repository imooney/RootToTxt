#what follows should be the basename of the histograms from which to pull the values. E.g. with 2 datasets (say 200, 500 GeV) & 2 selections of pT, what follows would be something like "name200_" (newline) "name500_" [no quotes]. It is assumed that the histograms for the different pT (or other) selections will be numbered, indexed from 0, so it expects you then to have four histograms: "name200_0", "name200_1", "name500_0", and "name500_1".

#number of uncertainties on each distribution (e.g. 2 if 1 statistical & 1 systematic). It is assumed that all datasets and "panels" have the same number of uncertainties.

#basename of histogram for each error. E.g. for above example, if N_uncertainties = 2, then the lines below should be something like: "herr0_200_" (newline) "herr1_200_" (newline) "herr0_500_" (newline) "herr1_500_" [no quotes] [in that order, i.e. dataset0's K histograms for uncertainties followed by dataset1's K histograms for uncertainties]. [It's also likely that the name of at least one of the uncertainty histograms is the same as the result histogram name, which is fine.] If there are no uncertainties, make sure after the newline of this comment, we go straight to the next comment with no blank lines.

#labels (e.g. for 2 errors, one statistical and one systematic it'd be: "stat" (newline) "syst"). All uncertainties assumed symmetric for the forseeable future.
